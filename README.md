Please find my R script for COMP4027 Coursework 2. The code imports the original dataset (which I had saved into my working directory). 
It includes how I produced my example exploratory boxplots, how I calculated medians, and how I produced my final parallel coordinates plot.
Note that at one stage, I exported the dataframe to a spreadsheet, and made a minor change as it was easier in excel - 
all I did here was merge the Diet Group and Sex columns.

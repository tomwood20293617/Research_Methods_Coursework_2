Please find my R script for COMP4027 Coursework 2. The code imports the original dataset (which i had saved into my working directory). 
It includes how i produced my example exploratory boxplots, how I calculated medians, and how i produced my final parallel coordinates plot.
Note that at one stage, i exported the dataframe to a spreadsheet, and made a minor change as it was easier in excel - 
all i did here was merge the diet group and sex columns
